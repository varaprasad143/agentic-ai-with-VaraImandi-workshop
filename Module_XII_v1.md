![Capstone & Portfolio](12_Capstone_and_Portfolio/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: Project planning leads to portfolio development, validation/testing, documentation/presentation, and sharing/next steps.*

## Setup

### 1. Python Environment
> Use Python 3.13.5+ and a fresh virtual environment for best results.

```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_capstone_env
source agentic_capstone_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy rich matplotlib fastapi pydantic pytest jupyterlab
```

### 3. Environment Validation
Save as `test_capstone_setup.py` and run:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("üîç Testing Capstone Project Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("matplotlib", "Matplotlib"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest"),
        ("jupyterlab", "JupyterLab")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\nüìä Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("üéâ Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Capstone Project Planning
- Defined a real-world agentic AI problem and outlined project goals.
- Created a project plan with milestones, deliverables, and evaluation criteria.
- **Pro Tip:** Choose a project that excites you and aligns with your long-term goals.

---

## 2. Portfolio Development
- Organized code, documentation, and results in a clear, professional structure.
- Used JupyterLab for interactive demos and FastAPI for live endpoints.
- **Pro Tip:** Make your portfolio easy to navigate‚Äîuse README files, clear folder names, and visual summaries.

---

## 3. Project Validation and Testing
- Developed comprehensive test scripts using `pytest` to validate all project components.
- Included reproducibility checks and environment validation.
- **Pro Tip:** Automate your tests and validation scripts to save time and ensure reliability.

---

## 4. Documentation and Presentation
- Documented all code, design decisions, and results with Markdown and Jupyter notebooks.
- Prepared a project presentation with visualizations and live demos.
- **Pro Tip:** Tell a story with your documentation‚Äîexplain the why, not just the how.

---

## 5. Sharing and Next Steps
- Published the project on GitHub and shared with the community.
- Outlined next steps for further development or research.
- **Pro Tip:** Share your work widely‚Äîfeedback and collaboration lead to growth!

---

## Module Summary
- Completed a capstone project and built a professional portfolio in agentic AI.
- All code and documentation are modular, reproducible, and tested for Python 3.13.5+ compatibility.
- **Motivation:** Your capstone is your launchpad‚Äîshowcase your skills, share your journey, and take the next step in your AI career!
