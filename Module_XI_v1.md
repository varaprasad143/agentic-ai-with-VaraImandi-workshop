![Future Trends & Research](11_Future_Trends_and_Research/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: Emerging trends lead to benchmarking, reproducibility, open questions, and contributing.*

## Setup

### 1. Python Environment
> Use Python 3.13.5+ and a fresh virtual environment for best results.

```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_future_env
source agentic_future_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy rich matplotlib scikit-learn fastapi pydantic pytest
```

### 3. Environment Validation
Save as `test_future_setup.py` and run:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("üîç Testing Future Trends Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("matplotlib", "Matplotlib"),
        ("sklearn", "scikit-learn"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\nüìä Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("üéâ Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```
