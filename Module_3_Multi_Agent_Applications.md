# Module III (Enhanced): Multi-Agent Applications

![Multi-Agent System Pipeline](03_Multi_Agent_Applications/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: Agents are created, assigned tasks, communicate, coordinate, and aggregate results.*

## Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.13.5
> Download and install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3.13 -m venv multi_agent_env
# Creates a new isolated Python environment

source multi_agent_env/bin/activate
# Activates the environment (use the appropriate command for your OS)
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
# Upgrades pip to the latest version

pip install asyncio pydantic fastapi uvicorn aiohttp pytest
# Installs async, validation, and web libraries for agentic systems

pip install numpy pandas
# Installs data processing libraries (if needed for agent tasks)

pip install rich
# Installs rich for beautiful CLI output (optional)
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Save the following as `test_multi_agent_setup.py` and run it:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("🔍 Testing Multi-Agent Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("asyncio", "AsyncIO"),
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("uvicorn", "Uvicorn"),
        ("aiohttp", "AioHTTP"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("rich", "Rich")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"✅ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"❌ {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\n📊 Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("🎉 Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("⚠️ Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Agent Fundamentals & Communication
- Built robust agent classes with asynchronous message handling and a modular message bus.
- Enabled agent-to-agent communication, state management, and extensible capabilities.
- **Pro Tip:** Modularize your agent and message bus logic for easy extension and testing.

---

## 2. Agent Communication Patterns
- Implemented publish-subscribe and request-response patterns for real-time data updates and service calls.
- Demonstrated scalable, decoupled event-driven systems and direct service workflows.
- **Pro Tip:** Use publish-subscribe for scalable event-driven systems; request-response for direct, synchronous workflows.

---

## 3. Distributed Coordination & Conflict Resolution
- Coordinated distributed agents for complex tasks, dynamic assignment, and conflict resolution (voting/consensus).
- Simulated real-world distributed task assignment and agent availability.
- **Pro Tip:** Add random delays or simulated failures to make your system more resilient!

---

## 4. Orchestration & Workflow Management
- Orchestrated multi-step workflows, managed dependencies, and monitored execution across agents.
- Ran complex workflows with parallel and dependent tasks, handling timeouts and failures gracefully.
- **Pro Tip:** Visualize workflow DAGs to debug and optimize task dependencies.

---

## Module Summary
- Built a full-featured multi-agent system, from core agent logic to advanced orchestration.
- All code is modular, extensible, and validated for reproducibility.
- Combined agent communication, distributed coordination, and workflow management for real-world AI applications.
- **Extra Tip:** Extend the demos with your own agent types or integrate with external APIs for even more powerful workflows!
