*Figure: Hierarchical agents, swarms, coordination/consensus, and advanced communication patterns.*

## Setup

### 1. Python Environment
> Use Python 3.13.5+ and a fresh virtual environment for best results.

```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_arch_env
source agentic_arch_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy rich networkx matplotlib fastapi pydantic
pip install pytest
```

### 3. Environment Validation
Save as `test_arch_setup.py` and run:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("üîç Testing Agent Architectures Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("networkx", "NetworkX"),
        ("matplotlib", "Matplotlib"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\nüìä Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("üéâ Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Hierarchical Agents: Building Agent Trees
- Designed multi-level agent hierarchies for task decomposition and delegation.
- Used NetworkX to visualize agent trees and communication flows.
- **Pro Tip:** Use hierarchical agents to break down complex goals into manageable subtasks.

---

## 2. Agent Swarms and Emergent Behaviors
- Simulated agent swarms and collective intelligence using simple local rules.
- Observed emergent behaviors and group problem-solving.
- **Pro Tip:** Swarm intelligence often emerges from simple rules‚Äîexperiment with different local policies!

---

## 3. Coordination and Consensus Strategies
- Implemented coordination protocols (leader election, voting, consensus) for distributed agents.
- Used graph algorithms to model and analyze agent interactions.
- **Pro Tip:** Use consensus algorithms to ensure reliability in distributed agent systems.

---

## 4. Advanced Communication Patterns
- Explored broadcast, multicast, and peer-to-peer agent messaging.
- Designed robust communication topologies for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Pro Tip:** Choose the right communication pattern for your agent network's scale and reliability needs.

---

## Module Summary
- Mastered advanced agent architectures: hierarchies, swarms, coordination, and communication patterns.
- All code is modular, extensible, and validated for reproducibility.
- **Motivation:** Advanced architectures unlock new levels of agent capability. Experiment, visualize, and push the boundaries of what your agents can do!
