![Performance Optimization & Monitoring](10_Performance_Optimization_and_Monitoring/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: Profiling leads to optimization, advanced monitoring, resource management, and bottleneck analysis.*

## Setup

### 1. Python Environment
> Use Python 3.13.5+ and a fresh virtual environment for best results.

```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_perf_env
source agentic_perf_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy rich matplotlib psutil memory_profiler line_profiler fastapi uvicorn prometheus_client
pip install pytest
```

### 3. Environment Validation
Save as `test_perf_setup.py` and run:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("üîç Testing Performance Optimization Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("matplotlib", "Matplotlib"),
        ("psutil", "psutil"),
        ("memory_profiler", "memory_profiler"),
        ("line_profiler", "line_profiler"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("uvicorn", "Uvicorn"),
        ("prometheus_client", "Prometheus Client"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\nüìä Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("üéâ Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Performance Profiling: Finding Bottlenecks
- Used `line_profiler` and `memory_profiler` to identify slow and memory-intensive code.
- Visualized performance metrics with Matplotlib and Rich.
- **Pro Tip:** Profile before you optimize‚Äîmeasure first, then act!

---

## 2. Optimization Techniques
- Applied vectorization, caching, and parallelization to speed up agentic workflows.
- Used NumPy and multiprocessing for efficient computation.
- **Pro Tip:** Start with algorithmic improvements before reaching for parallelism.

---

## 3. Advanced Monitoring in Production
- Integrated Prometheus and custom FastAPI endpoints for real-time performance metrics.
- Set up dashboards to monitor latency, throughput, and resource usage.
- **Pro Tip:** Monitor both system and application-level metrics for a complete picture.

---

## 4. Resource Management and Scaling
- Used `psutil` to track CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- Implemented auto-scaling triggers based on real-time resource metrics.
- **Pro Tip:** Automate scaling based on observed load, not just static thresholds.

---

## 5. Bottleneck Analysis and Continuous Improvement
- Established a feedback loop for ongoing performance tuning.
- Used test-driven optimization to ensure improvements don't break functionality.
- **Pro Tip:** Make performance optimization a regular part of your development cycle.

---

## Module Summary
- Mastered performance profiling, optimization, advanced monitoring, and resource management for agentic AI.
- All code is modular, extensible, and validated for reproducibility.
- **Motivation:** High performance and observability are the foundation of robust, scalable AI. Keep measuring, keep optimizing, and keep pushing the limits!
