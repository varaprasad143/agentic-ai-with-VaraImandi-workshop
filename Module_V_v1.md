# Module V (Enhanced): Agentic Design Patterns

![Agentic Design Patterns](05_Agentic_Design_Patterns/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: The ReAct pattern leads to reflection, code action, pattern integration, and optimization/error handling.*

## Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.13.5
> Download and install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_patterns_env
# Creates a new isolated Python environment

source agentic_patterns_env/bin/activate
# Activates the environment (use the appropriate command for your OS)
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
# Upgrades pip to the latest version

pip install pydantic numpy pandas rich
# Installs core libraries for agentic design patterns

pip install pytest
# Installs testing framework
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Save the following as `test_agentic_patterns_setup.py` and run it:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("🔍 Testing Agentic Patterns Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"✅ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"❌ {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\n📊 Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("🎉 Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("⚠️ Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. ReAct Framework: Reasoning + Acting Agents
- Built agents that reason, act, observe, and reflect in a synergistic loop.
- Modular ReActStep, Thought, Action, and Observation classes for step-by-step agent cycles.
- **Pro Tip:** Use the ReAct cycle to break down complex problems into manageable steps—just like a human would!

---

## 2. Reflection Patterns: Self-Improving Agents
- Implemented meta-cognitive agents that learn from their own actions and mistakes.
- Added logging and feedback loops for continuous self-improvement.
- **Pro Tip:** Add structured logging and feedback to help your agents self-improve over time.

---

## 3. CodeAct Systems: Dynamic Code Execution
- Enabled agents to write, execute, and debug code dynamically and safely.
- Used sandboxing and strict validation for secure code execution.
- **Pro Tip:** Always sandbox and validate code before execution to ensure safety and reliability.

---

## 4. Pattern Integration: Combining Design Patterns
- Combined multiple design patterns for more powerful, adaptive agent behaviors.
- Modularized patterns for easy mixing and matching in different tasks.
- **Pro Tip:** Modularize your patterns so you can mix and match them for different agentic workflows.

---

## 5. Optimization & Error Handling
- Fine-tuned agent performance and implemented robust fallback strategies.
- Provided fallback logic for critical agent actions to ensure resilience.
- **Pro Tip:** Always provide fallback logic and monitor agent performance for continuous improvement.

---

## Module Summary
- Mastered the most important agentic design patterns: ReAct, Reflection, CodeAct, and their integration.
- All code is modular, extensible, and validated for reproducibility.
- Combined reasoning, acting, learning, and error handling for robust, adaptive AI agents.
- **Extra Tip:** Try extending these patterns with your own domain-specific logic or integrate them into larger multi-agent systems for even more powerful results!
