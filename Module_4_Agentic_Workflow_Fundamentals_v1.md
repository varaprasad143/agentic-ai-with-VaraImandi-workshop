![Agentic Workflow Pipeline](04_Agentic_Workflow_Fundamentals/module_flowchart_v1.png)
*Figure: Workflow design leads to task orchestration, error handling, and result aggregation.*

## Setup

### 1. Install Python 3.13.5
> Download and install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3.13 -m venv workflow_env
# Creates a new isolated Python environment

source workflow_env/bin/activate
# Activates the environment (use the appropriate command for your OS)
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
# Upgrades pip to the latest version

pip install asyncio pydantic fastapi uvicorn aiohttp pytest asyncpg motor aio_pika
# Installs async, validation, web, and integration libraries for workflow systems

pip install numpy pandas
# Installs data processing libraries (if needed for workflow tasks)

pip install rich
# Installs rich for beautiful CLI output (optional)
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Save the following as `test_workflow_setup.py` and run it:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("🔍 Testing Workflow Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("asyncio", "AsyncIO"),
        ("pydantic", "Pydantic"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("uvicorn", "Uvicorn"),
        ("aiohttp", "AioHTTP"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest"),
        ("asyncpg", "AsyncPG"),
        ("motor", "Motor"),
        ("aio_pika", "AioPika"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("rich", "Rich")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"✅ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"❌ {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\n📊 Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("🎉 Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("⚠️ Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Workflow Engine Fundamentals
- Designed a flexible, extensible workflow engine supporting sequential, parallel, conditional, event-driven, and loop patterns.
- Used async execution, retry logic, and event emission for robust orchestration.
- **Pro Tip:** Use enums and handler registration to easily extend your engine with new workflow patterns!

---

## 2. Integration & Adaptation
- Connected workflows to real-world systems (APIs, databases, message queues) with adapters and connectors.
- Implemented authentication, retries, and circuit breakers for robust integrations.
- **Pro Tip:** Always wrap external calls in try/except blocks and use exponential backoff for retries.

---

## 3. Monitoring, Security, and Scaling
- Added observability (metrics, logs), enforced security (access control, encryption), and demonstrated scaling patterns (auto-scaling, load balancing).
- Used centralized logging and metrics for easy debugging and performance tuning.
- **Pro Tip:** Tune thresholds and timeouts based on your system's real-world load and error rates.

---

## 4. Advanced Patterns & Error Recovery
- Implemented advanced workflow patterns and ensured graceful recovery from errors.
- Supported retries, timeouts, and error propagation; loop and conditional patterns as reusable components.
- **Pro Tip:** Visualize your workflow execution graphs to spot bottlenecks and optimize dependencies!

---

## 5. Comprehensive System Demo
- Integrated all components in a demo system, running a secure workflow with authentication and real integrations.
- Code is correct and complete; requires real endpoints and credentials for full execution.
- **Pro Tip:** Use Docker Compose to spin up all required services for local testing.

---

## Module Summary
- Built a production-grade agentic workflow engine, supporting all major execution patterns and real-world integrations.
- All code is modular, extensible, and validated for reproducibility.
- Combined workflow patterns, integration, monitoring, and error recovery for robust, scalable AI applications.
- **Extra Tip:** Start with the provided demo, then incrementally add your own task handlers and integrations for your use case!
