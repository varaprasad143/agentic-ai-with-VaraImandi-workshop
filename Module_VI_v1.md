![Observability & Monitoring](06_Observability_and_Monitoring/module_flowchart.png)
*Figure: Metrics and logging feed into tracing, dashboards, alerting/recovery, and agent health.*

## Setup

### 1. Python Environment
> Ensure you are using Python 3.13.5+ and a clean virtual environment.

```bash
python3.13 -m venv agentic_obs_env
source agentic_obs_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy rich matplotlib prometheus_client fastapi uvicorn
pip install pytest
```

### 3. Environment Validation
Save as `test_obs_setup.py` and run:
```python
import sys, os
from datetime import datetime

def test_installation():
    print("üîç Testing Observability Environment Setup...\n")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Test time: {datetime.now()}\n")
    tests = [
        ("pandas", "Pandas"),
        ("numpy", "NumPy"),
        ("rich", "Rich"),
        ("matplotlib", "Matplotlib"),
        ("prometheus_client", "Prometheus Client"),
        ("fastapi", "FastAPI"),
        ("uvicorn", "Uvicorn"),
        ("pytest", "Pytest")
    ]
    results = []
    for module, name in tests:
        try:
            __import__(module)
            print(f"‚úÖ {name}: Installed")
            results.append(True)
        except ImportError as e:
            print(f"‚ùå {name}: Not installed - {e}")
            results.append(False)
    success_rate = sum(results) / len(results) * 100
    print(f"\nüìä Installation Success Rate: {success_rate:.1f}%")
    if success_rate >= 80:
        print("üéâ Setup verification complete! You're ready to proceed.")
        return True
    else:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Some components failed. Please check the installation.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_installation()
```

## 1. Metrics and Logging: The Foundation of Observability
- Implemented structured logging for agent actions and system events.
- Collected custom metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) using Prometheus.
- **Pro Tip:** Use consistent log formats and metric names for easy aggregation and analysis.

---

## 2. Tracing Agent Workflows
- Added trace IDs to agent requests for end-to-end workflow visibility.
- Used FastAPI middleware and custom decorators for trace propagation.
- **Pro Tip:** Always propagate trace IDs through all agent calls for full visibility.

---

## 3. Dashboards and Visualization
- Built real-time dashboards with Matplotlib and Prometheus for monitoring agent health and performance.
- Visualized key metrics and trends to spot issues early.
- **Pro Tip:** Automate dashboard updates and set up visual alerts for critical metrics.

---

## 4. Alerting and Automated Recovery
- Configured alerting rules for error spikes and performance drops.
- Implemented auto-recovery logic for common agent failures.
- **Pro Tip:** Start with simple alert thresholds, then refine based on real-world data.

---

## 5. Agent Health and Self-Monitoring
- Enabled agents to report their own health and status.
- Used health endpoints and periodic self-checks for robust monitoring.
- **Pro Tip:** Build health checks into every agent and expose them via HTTP endpoints.

---

## Module Summary
- Mastered observability for agentic AI: metrics, logging, tracing, dashboards, alerting, and health checks.
- All code is modular, reproducible, and ready for production monitoring.
- **Motivation:** Great observability is the secret to reliable, scalable, and trustworthy AI agents. Keep monitoring, keep improving!
